# youCOOK

Welcome!

This project is finished when I was a fellow at Insight Data Science.
-Millions of people prefer YouTube How-to cook videos to prepare their next meal instead of following recipe web site directions. These directions are very hard to follow, because reading text as it is now is hard. 
-Billion subscribe these channels and videos attract billions of viewers.
-However, list of ingredients in the videos are not available and you need to look at actual video to get the actual video. Well it really takes time if you watch 10 videos. This takes time. 
-Here, I build a web site, that search YouTube videos and gives ingredients next to each video.

I build a custom Name Entity Recognition model using spaCy Natural Language Process. Web-site is accesible at youcook.xyz:5000 and is running in Amozon Web Services. I used Flask framework with my project.
