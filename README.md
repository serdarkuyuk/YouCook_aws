# YouCOOK project

A custom Name Entity Recognition algorithm using Natural Language Processing at Insight Data Science.
This project is finished when I was a fellow at Insight Data Science. 

## Motivation for the project:
- Millions of people prefer YouTube How-to cook videos to prepare their next meal instead of following recipe web site directions. These directions are very hard to follow, because reading text as it is now is hard. 
- Billion subscribe these channels and videos attract billions of viewers. 
- However, list of ingredients in the videos are not available and you need to look at actual video to get the ingredients. Well it really takes time if you watch 10 videos. This takes time. 
- Here, I build a web site, that search YouTube videos and gives ingredients next to each video.

## Setup
Clone repository and update python path
```
repo_name=https://github.com/serdarkuyuk/YouCook_aws.git
username= # Username for your personal github account
git clone https://github.com/serdarkuyuk/YouCook_aws.git
```

## Requisites

- List all packages and software needed to build the environment
- This could include cloud command line tools (i.e. gsutil), package managers (i.e. conda), etc.

#### Dependencies

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

#### Installation
To install the package above, pleae run:
```shell
pip install -r requiremnts
```

## Test
- To run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# flask run --host=0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Build Model
- Go to training folder
- This is done locally or in the cloud
- data folder has database
- models folder holds the trained model (if you do not have, it will create for you)
```
# Example

# python training.py
```

Welcome!

This project is finished when I was a fellow at Insight Data Science.

  -Here, I build a web site, that search YouTube videos and gives ingredients next to each video.

I build a custom Name Entity Recognition model using spaCy Natural Language Process. Web-site is accesible at youcook.xyz:5000 and is running in Amozon Web Services. I used Flask framework with my project.
